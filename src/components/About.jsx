            <p>Hi, I'm Saidat Alli. I'm a full-stack Software Engineer based in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. I specialize in building and improving the online presence for my clients. My goal is to create a modern, responsive and user-friendly website and web app for you.
            <br></br>
            I also build business websites with SEO in mind, so you can rank higher on Google search results. When I am not coding, I do loads of cardio because I have a sweet tooth. I also enjoy trying new recipes.</p>
