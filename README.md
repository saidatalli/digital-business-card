## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React + Vite, JSX, CSS

I used React + Vite for the frontend web development. It minimized initial setup and it is perfect for snappy and modern development experience. I seperated the content into seperate components.

## Installation
1. Clone Repo
2. Run `npm install` to install node modules

## Usage
You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.
1. Run `npm run dev` to the app in the development mode.
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173/` to view in browser. The page will reload when you make changes.


## Optimizations

I would like to use `webpack.config.js` file so I could better understand the build process.

## Reflection:

My project goals were to learn more about Vite and familiarise myself with its documentation.
